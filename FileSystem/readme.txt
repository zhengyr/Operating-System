In this project, you will supply modules that complete the design of a simple file system on top of a simulated disk. Your file system provides a standard seek/read/write interface and uses inodes and single, double, and triple indirection to support large files (similar to the class UNIX file system model we learned in class).Your task is to add code for bitwise operations to complete the free space bitmap, and to add indirection to support files larger than 10 blocks.
